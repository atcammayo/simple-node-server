               <h3>The Story of Anthony</h3>
               
              
          <p>I grew up in a small town in the province of Isabela where the our way of living is simple. 
          I never knew my father because he left us when I was just a child. I am the only child in our family. I live with my grandparents. 
          I grew up lacking a father figure to send me to and fetch me at school,to play with me 
          or carry me in his arms whenever I cry, and I am very blessed that my mother did it all for me. Back then I remember,I was very fond of reading story books, and my mom would always tell me that 
          I was the kid who was always happy playing all by herself.</p>

                My high school is one of the colorful chapters in my life. I was'nt an achiever back then but I have plenty of friends.
                We had our experiences to share with each other. Even we are away from each other,
                we make sure to find time to reunite and update each other about the happenings in our life.

                so that I can help my family and my future "family". Also, I want ot travel the world with my loved ones.
