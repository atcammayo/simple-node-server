          <em>My Top 3 Movie Picks</em>
          <br>
          <p>The third spot goes to  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUXWAEX2jlg"> Fight Club </a>. This is one of my favorites because I love the twist of the story. It is about a A ticking-time-bomb insomniac (Norton) and a slippery soap salesman (Pitt) channel primal male aggression into a shocking new form of therapy. Their concept catches on, with underground "fight clubs" forming in every town, until a sensuous eccentric (Bonham Carter) gets in the way and ignites an out-of control spiral toward oblivion.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Next is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yma-g4gTwlE"> This is The End </a>. I love this moive because I love how James Franco and Seth Rogen act. This Is The End follows six friends trapped in a house after a series of strange and catastrophic events devastate Los Angeles. As the world unravels outside, dwindling supplies and cabin fever threaten to tear apart the friendships inside. Eventually, they are forced to leave the house, facing their fate and the true meaning of friendship and redemption. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Finally, the top spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ_JOBCLF-I"> The LEGO Movie </a>. This is my ultimate favorite movie. The LEGO Movie is a 3D animated film which follows lead character, Emmet a completely ordinary LEGO mini-figure who is identified as the most "extraordinary person" and the key to saving the Lego universe. Emmet and his friends go on an epic journey to stop the evil tyrant, Lord Business. I love this movie because I am fascinated how they made the movie. Also, they put characters of my childhood like Superman, Batman, Gandalf, and many other movie characters which are dubbed by Morgan Freeman, Chris Patt, Will Ferrell and Elizabeth Banks. </p>
